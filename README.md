# DirectX 11 tuts from RasterTek.com
The original source codes from the DX11 tutorials (combined series 1 and 2) of [RasterTek.com](http://www.rastertek.com/)

I am placing the source code here because I am currently following the tutorials of RasterTek myself. They are some of the better tutorials I have found on the internet and thus I want to share it __with__ the changes I make to it.

# Requirements
- Visual Studio 2015 (Community suffices and is free)
- Windows SDK (is included in Visual Studio 2015)
